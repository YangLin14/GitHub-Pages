# üëã Hello! I'm Fong-Yu (Yang) Lin

Welcome to my personal corner on GitHub! I'm a **Computer Science** student at the _University of California San Diego (UCSD)_, expecting to graduate in 2026.

Originally from Taiwan üáπüáº, I moved to California with my mother about five years ago. My academic path initially led me to Electrical Engineering, but my fascination with building software, exploring AI, and solving complex problems prompted a switch to Computer Science. I thrive on learning new technologies and collaborating on impactful projects.

## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Beyond the Code

Life isn't just about coding! When I step away from the keyboard, I enjoy:

1.  **Cycling:** Exploring on my road bike üö≤ is a great way to clear my head.
2.  **Media:** I'm a fan of watching _anime_ and diving into video games üéÆ.
3.  **Sports:** Staying active with badminton üè∏, ping pong üèì, and volleyball üèê.
4.  **Running:** I committed to daily running starting March 2025 and I'm keeping the streak alive! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
5.  **Connecting:** I genuinely enjoy chatting with people, whether it's casual conversation or a deep dive into technical topics.
